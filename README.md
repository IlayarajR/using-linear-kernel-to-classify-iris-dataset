# using-linear-kernel-to-classify-iris-dataset
A linear kernel can be used for classification of the iris dataset using a support vector machine (SVM). This kernel is appropriate when the data is linearly separable, meaning it can be separated using a single line. It is one of the most common kernels to be used and is particularly useful when there are a large number of features in a dataset. In the case of the iris dataset, only the first two features, Sepal length and Sepal width, need to be considered. The linear models LinearSVC() and SVC(kernel=‘linear’) yield slightly different decision boundaries. Training an SVM with a linear kernel is faster than with any other kernel and only requires optimization of the C regularization parameter.
